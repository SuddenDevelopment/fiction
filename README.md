# fiction world building scaffold
This is intended to be a set of things to consider to build a world in which a story takes place. It's a simplistic way of organizing thoughts without any restrictions. The only reason to do it this way is so it can be easily linkable and backed up and reused as opposed to pen and paper. It's all in markdown which works well in git/github and local editors such as [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) Each information category is meant to have items and a template to copy for each item. I recommend looking at the template first to see if it meets your needs. If you have any requests of things to add, send me an issue and I'll update it.
